This is a simple word guesing game similar to the hangman game but more simple and easy to understand and code. Here, I have intialized the list of words as a list
in the code itself whereas it can be created outside the code like in a text file or even be obtained from the user input. Just to make it simple and easy to
understand for the beginners, I have created inside the code itself. This can be a great exercise for the beginners to understand the Python language and 
grasp the programming logic and apply it to problem-solving.
